A client side CSS stylesheet to "hack"/cheat at paper-io.com
# HowTo:
You need a custom CSS tool. In my case, i used the [Custom Style Script](http://mybrowseraddon.com/custom-style-script.html) addon.

Just copy the CSS content into the CSS box, reload paper-io.com, you are done.

Have fun being the best.
